1. A table of the achieved evaluation metrics (Classification: Accuracy, Recall, F1-Score | Detection: Average Precision, Mean-Average Precision, Intersection over Union(IoU)) of the classification and detection of the validation dataset.

| Classification Results |     |     |
| :--------------------: | :-: | :-: |
|        Accuracy        | 100%|     |
|         Recall         | 100%|     |
|        F1-Score        | 100%|     |

| Detection Results      |     |     |
| :--------------------: | :-: | :-: |
|   Average Precision    | 95.011%|   |
| Mean Average Precision @ 0.5-O.9 | 91.35%| |
| Mean Average Precision @ 0.5-0.9 | 77.296%| |
| Intersection over Union (@0.5) | 93.12%| |
| Box Loss               | 0.64311|    |
